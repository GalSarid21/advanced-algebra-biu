# Advanced Algebra Final Project
This repository contains the codebase for the final project of `Advanced Algebra` course at Bar-Ilan University (2025).<br><br>
It implements key mathematical concepts and algorithms related to finite fields, discrete logarithms, and field element operations.<br>
Central to the project is the Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS) algorithm, which efficiently solves the discrete logarithm problem in finite fields using a time-memory tradeoff.<br><br>
The `FiniteField` class models finite field extensions over prime fields defined by irreducible polynomials, enabling efficient group embeddings and element operations like addition, multiplication, and inversion.<br>
A task manager orchestrates the execution of complex field operations, utilizing abstraction to perform a range of mathematical computations and generate detailed logs for analysis and validation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Set Python Environment:
1. Make sure you have python version >= 3.10 on your machine:
```python
python --version
```

* If your version doesn't meet the above requirements, download a newer version from python.org (windows) or run `brew upgrade python` on terminal (mac).

2. Clone the project.

3. Open project's main folder (advanced-algebra-biu).

4. Create a virtual environment under a new `venv` folder:
```python
python -m venv ./venv
```

5. Activate the new environment:
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

* When the `venv` is activated, its name should appear in brackets at the beginning of your terminal prompt. For example:
```bash
saridg@mobl advanced-algebra-biu %
(venv) saridg@mobl advanced-algebra-biu %
```

6. Optional (if running in IDE): set new created python interpreter as IDE interpreter:<br>
&ensp;6.1 On VSCode:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.1.1 Open VS Code.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.1.2 Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) to open the Command Palette.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.1.3 Search for "Python: Select Interpreter" and select it.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.1.4 Choose the desired Python interpreter from the list (e.g., python3, venv, or a conda env).<br>
&ensp;6.2 On PyCharm:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.2.1 Open PyCharm and go to File > Settings (Ctrl + Alt + S on Windows/Linux, Cmd + , on Mac).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.2.2 Navigate to Project: <your_project> > Python Interpreter.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.2.3 Click the gear icon and choose Add Interpreter.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.2.4 Select System Interpreter, Virtualenv, or Conda, and set the correct Python path.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;6.2.5 Click OK/Apply to save changes.<br>

7. Pip-install the project packages using `requirements.txt` file:
```pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üèÉ Running Assignment Sections (Tasks) Locally:

1. Running the project is possible using a simple cli command:
```python
python main.py --task section-2
```

2. Supported cli arguments:
```description
-- task: An assignment section to run.
* tasks: [
    section-2: run the code relevant to section 2.
    run-all: run all the implemented sections.
]
```


## üê≥ Running Assignment Sections (Tasks) With Docker Container:
1. Make sure you have a docker installation on your machine:
```bash
docker --version
```

* If Docker is not installed or outdated, download the latest version from docker.com (windows) or run brew install --cask docker on terminal (mac).

2. Pull public image:
```bash
docker pull saridga/biu:advanced-algebra
```

* You can tag it with a shorter name for convenience:
```bash
docker tag saridga/biu:advanced-algebra advanced-algebra:latest
```

3. Set local directory for output log files:
```bash
export LOG_DIR=/path/to/local/folder
```

4. Run a container using the pulled image and `LOG_DIR`:
```bash
docker run --rm -v ${LOG_DIR}:/app/logs -e TASK=run-all advanced-algebra
```

* You can target any specific task you want using the docker environment variable `TASK`.<br>
* Once the process run completes, the container should be removed, and `LOG_DIR` should contain a new log file.


## üì§ Outputs:

1. The task manager generates a log file stored in the `logs` directory (created at runtime if not exists).

2. The log file consolidates all the section test results.

3. The log filename follows the format `app_yyyyMMdd_uuid.log`, where `yyyyMMdd` represents the run date, and a unique UUID ensures a new file is created for each execution.

4. Example log file (Section 2 results):
```bash
File Name: app_20250309_v6r5W8iARA-W9z-uAqlGgA.log
